Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Mason,

I am writing to you from a magnificent spaceship in a ugly galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a black rocket in November. There are 3 monkeys and capybaras of spaceship here! In the
library there is a pool full of stars. I fall asleep each night on a superior bed of pillows and dream of exploring everyday. It feels as though I have lived here for
117 milliseconds. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
pottery class on a hungry Tesla!!

Best wishes,
Caelli
